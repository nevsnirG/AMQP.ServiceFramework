# AMQP.ServiceFramework
Framework for attribute-based message routing.

## Introduction
ServiceFramework allows for ASP-like control over message routing. Using attribute-based mapping messages can be routed to handlers methods. It automatically discovers all handler methods in the executing assembly and subscribes to the message queue for you. Dependency injection is integrated using the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection framework and Logging is integrated using the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging framework.
